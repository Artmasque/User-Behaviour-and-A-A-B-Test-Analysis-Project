# User-Behaviour-and-A-A-B-Test-Analysis-Project
# Project Description / Business Problem

You work at a startup that sells food products. You need to investigate user behavior for the company's app. First study the sales funnel. Find out how users reach the purchase stage.
Then look at the results of an A/A/B test. The designers would like to change the fonts for the entire app, but the managers are afraid the users might find the new design intimidating. They decide to make a decision based on the results of an A/A/B test. The users are split into three groups: two control groups get the old fonts and one test group gets the new ones. Find out which set of fonts produces better results. You'll be using the same dataset for general analytics and for A/A/B analysis. In real projects, experiments are constantly being conducted. Analysts study the quality of an app using general data, without paying attention to whether users are participating in experiments.
